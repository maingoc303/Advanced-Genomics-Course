# Advanced-Genomics-Course
This is homework that is assigned for the course Advanced Method for Genomics. There are 2 projects that focus on discover genes that are differently expressed between treatments/ groups.
  * One project analyses the gene expression through microarray data and takes pathway analysis into account to provide more insightful information about the genomics
  * The other project analyses the RNA-seq data from NGS technology. Data here is now discrete (count) data, not gaussian as the first project. The approach for analysis will adjusted a little bit for dealing with the count data
